# Project #1: AirBNB sales
  In this project I looked at data about AirBNB sales in Seattle, washignton from year 2016. Data contains information about Seattle Zipcodes, number of rooms, Price, etc. 

#### Analysis Questions:
  1. What Room quantity is being rented out more?
  2. What is the average price to rent an Airbnb by Bedroom amount?
  3. What's the average price by Zipcode?
  4. What time of the year do people rent AirBNB the most?

#### Data Findings:
  1. The more rooms an AirBNB had, the lower amount of rentals. 1 bedroom AirBnb were more likely to have more rentals with 1,811 rentals in 2016.
  2. The less rooms an AirBNB has, the more cheaper it is to book the AirBNB.
  3. The more closer that the Zupcode is to Downtown Seattle, the more expensive the AirBNB.
  4. There's an upward trend of bookings from April 3rd to about the beginning July and a 2nd upward trend from November to the beginning of Janurary 2017.
