# Project #1: AirBNB sales
   In this project I analyzed data about Airbnb sales from year 2016, specifally from Seattle, Washington. The data consists of information about the locations zipcodes, the number of rooms the Airbnb has, The price it costs to book it, etc. Below are the questions I looked for in my analysis. 

#### Questions:
  1. What room quantity booked the most? 
  2. What is the average price to rent an Airbnb by Bedroom count?
  3. What's the average price to rent an Airbnb by zipcode?
  4. What time of the year do people rent Airbnb's the most?

#### Dashboard:

#### Data Findings:
  1. The more rooms an Airbnb had, the less bookings. One bedroom Airbnb's were more likely to have more rentals, with 1,811 rentals in 2016. A 6 bedroom Airbnb had the least rentals, with five rentals.
  2. The smaller the bedroom amount an Airbnb had, the cheaper it was to rent. 
  3. The closer the zipcode zone is to central Seattle, the more expensive the AirBNB.
  4. There's an upward trend of Airbnb rentals from April 3rd  to about the beginning July 2016 and a 2nd upward trend from November to the start of Janurary 2017.
