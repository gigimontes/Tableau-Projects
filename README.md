# Project #1: AirBNB sales
   In this project I analyzed data about Airbnb sales from year 2016, specifally from Seattle, Washington. The data consists of information about the locations zipcodes, the number of rooms the Airbnb has, The price it costs to book it, etc. Below are the questions I looked for in my analysis. 

#### Questions:
  1. What room quantity booked the most? 
  2. What is the average price to rent an Airbnb by Bedroom count?
  3. What's the average price to rent an Airbnb by zipcode?
  4. What time of the year do people rent Airbnb's the most?

#### Dashboard:

#### Data Findings:
  1. The more rooms an Airbnb had, the less bookings. One bedroom Airbnb's were more likely to have more rentals, with 1,811 rentals in 2016. A 6 bedroom Airbnb had the least rentals, with five rentals.
  2. The smaller the bedroom amount an Airbnb had, the cheaper it was to rent. 
  3. The closer the zipcode zone is to central Seattle, the more expensive the AirBNB.
  4. There's an upward trend of Airbnb rentals from April 3rd  to about the beginning July 2016 and a 2nd upward trend from November to the start of January 2017.

# Project #2: Pokemon Unite Infographics

#### Project Overview
   I analyzed data from the Video Game Pokemon Unite for those who are new players or interested in playing Pokemon Unite but are unsure what it’s about and what to expect. 

#### Data Source
   I retrieved the data source using the  “Pokemon Unite Dataset” provided by Shashanka Shekhar on Kaggle. You can access the data by clicking here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishushekhar/pokemonunitedataset

#### Tools Used for Project
   - Excel
      - Download Excel file here

   - Tableau
      - Link to Report here

#### Data Cleaning/preparation
   - Looked for Duplicates
   - Looked for Missing data
   - Looked for Empty spaces

#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
   One way I like thinking about what questions I should look into for my personal projects is placing myself in the 'stakeholders' shoes. In this case it would be for someone interested/new player playing Pokemon Unite, so my big question would be “what questions would be helpful to know for someone who wants to start playing? ” That being said, these are the questions I looked for in my analysis:

   - What’s the game about?
   - How many pokemon are in the game for players to use?
   - How many pokemon are in each difficulty ? 
   - How many pokemon are in each difficulty based on the Pokemon role? 
   - What are the average attributes based on the Pokemon’s role?
   - What type of fighting style are there in the game and how many per role?

#### Data Analysis:

#### Results:

#### Recommendations: 
   - Intermediate usage difficulty category has the most pokemon therefore as players get better at the game they will have a larger realm of pokemon choices to play and 
     explore. 
   - If the player prefers a ranged fighting style they should try out an Attacker, Defender, or supporter Roles.
   - If the player prefers a Melee fighting style then they should consider trying All-rounder, defender, speedster, and supporter Roles. 
   - If the New player is interested in playing a Speedster role Pokemon they should consider that most Speedster’s pokemon are categorized as Expert difficulty.
   - If the player prefers to make thier selection of what role they want to play by Attributes Statistics then I would at the Attribute Average By Role section on 
     the data visualization.
