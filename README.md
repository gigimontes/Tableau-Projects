# Project #1: AirBNB sales üèòÔ∏èüìà

## Project Overview
 I analyzed data regarding Seattle's Washington Airbnb sales from the year 2016. 

## Data Source
I downloaded the data called "Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset" provided by Alex the Analyst on kaggle. To access the data on Kaggle click here: [Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset/data)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
Although the data used in this project was clean, I still made sure that the data didn't have the following:
 - Duplicates
 - Empty Spaces
 - Wrong Data type
 - Missing Data
   
## Exploratory Data Analysis

The questions that I looked into for this project are:

 1. What room quantity was booked the most? 
  2. What is the average price to rent an Airbnb by Bedroom count?
  3. What's the average price to rent an Airbnb by zip code?
  4. What time of the year do people rent Airbnb's the most?

## Results

After analyzing the data I found: 

- The more rooms an Airbnb had, the less bookings. One bedroom Airbnb's were more likely to have more rentals, with 1,811 rentals in 2016. A 6 bedroom Airbnb had the least rentals, with five rentals.
- The smaller the bedroom count an Airbnb had, the cheaper it was to rent.
- The closer the zipcode zone is to central Seattle, the more expensive the AirBNB.
- There's an upward trend of Airbnb rentals from April 3rd  to about the beginning of July 2016 and a 2nd upward trend from November to the start of January 2017.


## Recommendations
For someone who‚Äôs interested in being a seller and renting an Airbnb in the downtown Seattle Washington area in 2017 I would recommend:

- Sell a 1 bedroom AirBnb considering that 1 bedroom Airbnb had the most rentals in 2016. 
- March would be a good time to start renting an Airbnb since there‚Äôs an upward trend from April-July and from November-January, which is the time of the year that most    
  people are traveling due summer vacation or the holiday season.
- I would invest into renting out an Airbnb closer to downtown Seattle since they can charge more for a room and a higher traffic of people. 


# Project #2: Pokemon Unite New Player Guide üéÆ

## Project Overview
   I analyzed data from the Video Game Pokemon Unite for those who are new players or interested in playing Pokemon Unite but are unsure what it‚Äôs about and what to expect.

##  Data Cleaning/preparation
Although the data used in this project was clean, I still made sure that the data didn't have the following:
 - Duplicates
 - Empty Spaces
 - Wrong Data type
 - Missing Data

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
   One way I like thinking about what questions I should look into for my personal projects is placing myself in the 'stakeholders' shoes. In this case it would be for someone interested/new player playing Pokemon Unite, so my big question would be ‚Äúwhat questions would be helpful to know for someone who wants to start playing? ‚Äù This project was inspired from a conversation that I had with a friend who was interested in playing the game. That being said, these are the questions I looked for in my analysis:

   - What‚Äôs the game about?
   - How many pokemon are in the game for players to use?
   - How many pokemon are in each difficulty ? 
   - How many pokemon are in each difficulty based on the Pokemon role? 
   - What are the average attributes based on the Pokemon‚Äôs role?
   - What type of fighting style are there in the game and how many per 
     role?

## Results
![Pokemon Unite Tableau Dashboard ](https://github.com/gigimontes/Tableau-Projects/assets/143570053/db0223fe-cd7e-4ab4-8076-afd40f2ab262)

 - Thier are 62 pokemon choices that players can choose from.
 - There are 20 novice Pokemon, 28 intermediate Pokemon, and 14 expert Pokemon 
   Out of all the roles, Attacker has the most Pokemon choices for Novice Difficulty, All-Rounder has the most Pokemon choices for Intermediate, and Speedster has the most 
   Pokemon choices for Expert. 
 - The most Pokemon for the ranged fighting type role is Attacker (20 choices) meanwhile for Melee fighting type is All-Rounder (16 choices). 
 - The highest Attribute Average by role is Defender for Endurance (3.750), Speedster for Mobility (3.813), Attacker for Offense (4.075), Speedster for Scoring (2.875), 
   and Support for Supporter (4.125).

## Recommendations: 
   - Intermediate usage difficulty category has the most pokemon therefore as players get better at the game they will have a larger realm of pokemon choices to play and 
     explore. 
   - If the player prefers a ranged fighting style they should try out an Attacker, Defender, or supporter Roles.
   - If the player prefers a Melee fighting style then they should consider trying All-rounder, defender, speedster, and supporter Roles. 
   - If the New player is interested in playing a Speedster role Pokemon they should consider that most Speedster‚Äôs pokemon are categorized as Expert difficulty.
   - If the player prefers to make thier selection of what role they want to play by Attributes Statistics then I would at the Attribute Average By Role section on 
     the data visualization.
